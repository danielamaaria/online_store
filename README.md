# Online Store
Online store website for all-purpose products. 

-A web application where you can add the books to the shopping cart and finally to buy them. I create this application for my final project at Software Development Academy.
-The technologies I had used were Python, Django, Heroku, Bootstrap4.

In addition to the features offered above, it provides buyers / visitors with two systems, the login and registration of a new account. The application is divided into:
• BACKEND - the functional part of the web application that connects to the database and with which only the programmer interacts 
• FRONTEND - that part of the web application that is visible. This in turn is divided into an area dedicated exclusively to the database administrator, an area dedicated to account visitors, and an area dedicated to all visitors to the application.
