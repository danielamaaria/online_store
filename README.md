# Online Store
Online store website for all-purpose products. 

The purpose of this project was to implement web applications that offer the possibility of adding, deleting, modifying or buying books from an online store as well as managing users of products through an intuitive graphical interface.

In addition to the features offered above, it provides buyers / visitors with two systems, the login and registration of a new account. The application is divided into:
• BACKEND - the functional part of the web application that connects to the database and with which only the programmer interacts 
• FRONTEND - that part of the web application that is visible. This in turn is divided into an area dedicated exclusively to the database administrator, an area dedicated to account visitors, and an area dedicated to all visitors to the application.
